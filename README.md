## Usage

Let's say you have 100 tabs open, in multiple windows.
You want to find a youtube tab of a talk you were watch a few hours ago.
Instead of going through all your tabs one by one, you could just type (in your address bar):

    ff youtube talk

and you will see a list of all the tabs that match the phrase `youtube` and `talk` in any order.

## Install

Download [chrome-ff.crx](https://github.com/siadat/chrome-ff/releases/download/1.1/chrome-ff-1.1.crx)
and drop it in your `chrome://extensions/` page.
