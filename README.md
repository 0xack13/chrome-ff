# Fuzzy Finder for Chrome

Adds fuzzy tab search to the omnibox.

## Usage

Let's say you have 100 tabs open, in multiple windows.
You want to find a youtube tab of a talk you were watching a few hours ago.
Instead of going through all your tabs one by one, you could just type (in your address bar):

    ff youtube talk

and you will see a list of all the tabs that match the phrase "youtube" and "talk" in any order.

Matching is fuzzy, so instead of "youtube", you could for example write "ytb".

If no matching open tab is found, the extension will show matching items in your history.
